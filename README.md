An educational voxel engine for the funzies.

## Minimal Dependencies - No Fuss - Clone'n'Go style.
- It's lightweight, with only a [single major dependency](https://threejs.org/), everything else is entirely [in-house](/src).
- It's highly adjustable: all voxel types have easily editable properties, binding-based controls, and a mostly event-based engine.
- It's as 'Raw JS' as it comes, there's no node, no browserify, no configuring, just clone'n'go.
